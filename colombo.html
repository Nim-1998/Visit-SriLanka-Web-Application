                            Its natural harbour at the mouth of the Kelani stream was a magnet for sequent traders and conquerors – at first the
                            Arab merchants, then Portuguese, Dutch and British imperialists.
                            
                            The city may be a jarring mixture of recent and new, with a central cluster of high-rise workplace blocks and hotels
                            overshadowing red-tiled colonial-era buildings and sprawling street markets that overflow with high-piled fruit and
                            vegetables, vibrant silks and cottons, and deliciously musky spices. On its thronged streets stand places of worship,

                            temples covered with Hindu statuary, at the side of Muslim mosques with minarets scattered on Colombo’s streets. Its
                            population is swollen by some four hundred,000 and traveling employees throughout the day and is just about empty once
                            dusk. there's a full of life nightlife at variety of International commonplace hotels, clubs, pubs and feeding venues
                            whereas it's restricted chiefly to the high finish client. throughout the day, Colombo’s vibrant street markets,

                            become the bastion of their rule for pretty much 150 years. astonishingly very little remains to attest to the present
                            era, excluding a scattering of Portuguese surnames within the phonebook and one or two of Roman Catholic churches and
                            seminaries representational process their design.
                            
                            The central space of town remains called Fort, however the remnants of the colonial battlements have long ago been
                            razed, or incorporated in newer buildings. There square measure a lot of mementoes of country amount, as well as the
                            neo-Classical recent parliament building, the Victorian-era President’s House (still usually known as ‘Queen’s House’),
